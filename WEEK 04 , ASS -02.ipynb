    "\n",
    "### 2. **Object**:\n",
    "An **object** is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until objects are created. Objects have both state (attributes) and behavior (methods). Each object can have different attribute values but will follow the structure defined by the class.\n",

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental or unauthorized modification of data.\n",
    "   - Example: In a class, data members can be made private, and access to them can be provided through public getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details and showing only essential features or behavior. It allows the user to interact with an object at a higher level, focusing on what it does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "   - Example: When using a car, the driver interacts with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift without needing to know the internal workings of the engine or transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "   - Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between parent (super) and child (sub) classes.\n",
    "   - Example: A class `Dog` can inherit from a class `Animal`, gaining access to its attributes like `name` and methods like `eat()`, while also adding its own specialized behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It provides the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different implementations, or have objects of different types respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
    "   - Example: A function `speak()` could be implemented in different classes like `Dog` and `Cat`, where `Dog.speak()` might output \"Bark\" and `Cat.speak()` outputs \"Meow\". \n",
    "\n",

    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the keyword `self` is used to represent the **instance of the class**. It is a reference to the current object, allowing you to access the instance's attributes and methods within the class definition. When defining methods in a class, `self` is the first parameter, and it must be explicitly included in the method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key reasons for using `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access to instance variables and methods**:\n",
    "   - `self` allows access to the attributes (variables) and methods of the current instance of the class. Without `self`, Python would not know which object's attributes or methods to refer to, especially when there are multiple objects of the same class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Distinguishing between instance and local variables**:\n",
    "   - The use of `self` helps to distinguish between instance variables (which belong to the object) and local variables (which are specific to the method). Instance variables are tied to a particular object, and `self` ensures they are accessed or modified correctly.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Passes the current object to methods**:\n",
    "   - When a method is called on an object, Python automatically passes the object itself (`self`) as the first argument to the method. This way, the method knows which specific object's data it is working with.\n",
